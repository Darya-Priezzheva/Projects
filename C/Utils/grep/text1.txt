Below are several tips to help you find your way: 
During the entire journey, you will be accompanied by the feeling of uncertainty and a severe shortage of information: THAT'S OK. It's a part of the game. Remember that the information in the repository and Google are always there for you. Just like other players. Communicate. Search. Collect. Do not be afraid to make a mistake. 
There may be a game inside the game, and another game inside it. That's normal. Just like in real life. Recursion is beautiful.
Levels can be very different from one another. That's normal. It's a part of the game. You can't just learn one recipe and apply it everywhere. The only way to achieve the goal is by continuously learning and adapting. 
It's a multiplayer game, even if it doesn't seem like it in the beginning.
You will, however, be able to get through most of it on your own.
Be careful with information sources. Check. Think. Analyze. Compare. Do not trust.
Pay attention to the text of the task. Think. Check.
If the task seems unclear or impossible–it only seems like it. Take your time, sit down in silence or with your favorite music. Get back to the task in 10–15 minutes and read the entire text once again. 
If tip #8 hasn't helped–search for a guide. You are surrounded by many wanderers just like you and they will be happy to help you find the exit.
Watch the time! It's deceitful. You have to complete at least one challenge a day!
